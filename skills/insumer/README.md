## Get started

Set the API key once (created via the `insumer-auth` skill):

```bash
export INSUMER_API_KEY='insr_live_...'
```

Then ask your agent something that triggers any of the skills above. They auto-activate based on the user's request — no manual invocation needed.

## API base

All skills assume the public API base:

```
https://api.insumermodel.com
```

## Verification

Every signed response is verifiable offline against the public JWKS at:

```
https://insumermodel.com/.well-known/jwks.json
```

The signing key never leaves the issuer; the verifier needs only the public key. See [`insumer-jwks-verify`](insumer-jwks-verify/) for the canonical recipe.
